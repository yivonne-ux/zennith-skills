# GAIA KNOWLEDGE SYNC — Claude Code → Zenni → All Agents

This file bridges Claude Code (Opus 4.6) and ALL OpenClaw agents. Claude Code writes learnings here after every session. **Zenni reads this FIRST** (she is the CEO — knows everything), then delegates relevant knowledge to Taoz, Dreami, Hermes, and others as needed.

**Readers:** Zenni (primary, every session) → Taoz (builds) → All agents (via Zenni delegation)

## SESSION SYNC — 2026-03-17 (QMDJ 十干克应 第八节 — 乙木 Yi Wood Section)

### PDF PROCESSED: 1_第八节_十干克应
- **Source:** `/Users/jennwoeiloh/.openclaw/media/inbound/1_第八节_十干克应---2d2517a2-7436-4356-914b-eccd947c0dc6.pdf`
- **Pages:** 4 (all image-based, extracted via visual reading)
- **Topic:** 十干克应 (Ten Stems Interactions) — Chapter 8, 乙木 (Yi Wood) section

### WHAT WAS EXTRACTED

**Theory (天盘vs地盘三奇六仪):**
- 天盘三奇六仪 = 事物本身 (the subject itself)
- 地盘三奇六仪 = 事物以外影响事物的因素 (external factors influencing the subject)
- 两大判断维度：①落宫能量比较（环境因素）②三奇六仪能量的时间因素
- Example: 辛+乙落坤宫 vs 辛+乙落艮宫 — same stems, different palace = totally different energy outcome

**All 9 Yi Wood (乙木) Combinations — now fully enriched:**
| Combination | Name | Core Meaning |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 乙+乙 | 日奇伏吟 | Stagnation, crooked paths, no progress |
| 乙+丙 | 奇仪顺遂 | Auspicious if lucky star; third party if inauspicious star |
| 乙+丁 | 奇仪相佐 | Best for documents, exams; new opportunities |
| 乙+戊 | 阴害阳门 | Favors yin/female actions; avoid public moves |
| 乙+己 | 日奇入墓 | Hope buried; illness unknown cause; avoid female action |
| 乙+庚 | 日奇被刑 | Each-for-themselves; litigation; "same bed different dreams" |
| 乙+辛 | 青龙逃走 | Fierce inauspicious; flight/escape; cloud-遁 when 3 lucky gates |
| 乙+壬 | 日奇入天罗 | Hierarchy disorder; plots; things still in flux |
| 乙+癸 | 日奇入地网 | Retreat not advance; hide; avoid confrontation |

**NEW DATA ADDED to qmdj-knowledge.json v2.1:**
- `imagery` (象意联想): Physical object/scene associations for each combination — used for environment reading, fortune telling symbolism
- `health_by_palace` (落宫疾病): Disease diagnosis by palace for ALL 9 combinations (乾坎艮震巽离坤兑)
- Enhanced `reason` and `situation` fields with more detail

**KEY HEALTH PATTERNS (for reading engine):**
- 乙+乙 → blood vessels/nerves tangled, leg problems, reproductive tract narrowing
- 乙+丙 → inflammation, burns, bile/liver inflammation by palace
- 乙+庚 → hardening (skin, liver, arteries), cancers, malignant diseases
- 乙+辛 → tumors, surgical history, stones
- 乙+癸 → infections, fluid accumulation, edema

### FILES UPDATED
1. `skills/psychic-reading-engine/data/qmdj-knowledge.json` → v2.1 (乙木 combinations enriched)
2. `skills/psychic-reading-engine/data/qmdj-pdfs-extracted.json` → PDF 13 marked EXTRACTED
3. `workspace/vault.db` → 2 new knowledge entries digested (137 total)

### FOR JADE ORACLE READING ENGINE
- `imagery` field is immediately usable for environment/context readings ("I see a bent road with a toll booth" → 乙+庚 pattern)
- `health_by_palace` enables specific body diagnosis when palace is known
- Combine with chart-symbols-extracted.json for full reading capability

## SESSION SYNC — 2026-03-12 18:30 (Character Body Pairing + Knowledge Transfer Protocol)

### NEW SKILL: character-body-pairing
- **What:** Pairs locked face refs with body/fashion refs to generate full-body lifestyle images
- **Location:** `skills/character-body-pairing/SKILL.md`
- **Agent use:** Iris (primary), Dreami (backup), Taoz (troubleshoot)
- **Tool:** `nanobanana-gen.sh generate --ref-image <face>,<body> --model pro`
- **Key rule:** ALWAYS match face vibe to body vibe (spiritual→spiritual, editorial→editorial)
- **5 documented gotchas:** body-ref hair overrides face-ref hair, B&W prompts get content refused, brand injection on lifestyle shots, two-face generation, style-seed interference
- **4 proven prompt templates** with success rates in SKILL.md
- **Learnings log:** `skills/character-body-pairing/learnings.jsonl` (8 entries from Luna v3)

### NEW SKILL: knowledge-transfer
- **What:** Protocol for turning Claude Code session learnings into OpenClaw-executable skills
- **Location:** `skills/knowledge-transfer/SKILL.md`
- **4-layer system:** SKILL.md (instructions) → learnings.jsonl (compounding) → classify.sh (discovery) → KNOWLEDGE-SYNC.md (bridge)
- **Quality test:** "Could Dreami do this alone?" — if not, skill needs more detail
- **Anti-patterns documented:** vague instructions, assumed knowledge, missing decision trees

### LUNA V3 BODY PAIRING RESULTS
- **4 face variants tested:** Wise-C (spiritual), Chic-H (edgy), Blonde-A (warm), Chic-C (editorial)
- **8 images generated:** 7 PASS, 1 PARTIAL (hair color override on Chic-C + street body ref)
- **Output:** `~/Desktop/luna-v3-body-pairs/` (8 images with descriptive names)
- **Key learning:** Silver/grey hair gets overridden when body ref has dark hair. Fix: add "DISTINCTIVE" before unusual hair colors or use body refs with matching hair.

## SESSION SYNC — 2026-03-11 18:10 (NanoBanana Seed Fix + Luna Master Pack QA)

### NANOBANANA SEED BANK FIX (CRITICAL)
- **Bug:** `nanobanana-gen.sh` character, batch, and storyboard modes registered images to seed bank with EMPTY prompt metadata
- **Impact:** 47+ jade-oracle images and all batch/character generations across ALL brands had bare seed entries (no prompt, no mood, no subject)
- **Fix:** All generation modes now pass actual prompt text to `register_image_seed`. Fixed in `/usr/local/bin/nanobanana-gen.sh`
- **Action for all agents:** Future NanoBanana generations will auto-register with full metadata. No workflow change needed.

### LUNA MASTER PACK — SUPERVISION NOTES
- **Drift detected:** Taoz dispatched Iris for only 2 shots, not the full 23-shot master pack. Prompts doc was written but never executed as structured work.
- **Correction sent:** Full 5-batch dispatch (9 angles + 3 full body + 5 attires + 3 spaces + 3 oracle deck) with explicit prompts from `luna-master-pack-prompts.md`
- **QA gate active:** Argus dispatched to audit every image — brand visual audit + face consistency check against locked reference
- **Face audit results (3 existing images):** All PASS — face_match 8-10/10, photorealism 9/10
- **Brand audit results:** PASS on mood/colors/photorealism, expected FAIL on typography/logo (these are character portraits, not ads)
- **File org:** NanoBanana saves to `images/jade-oracle/` by default. Will organize into `luna-master-pack/` subfolder after all 23 done.
- **Ref image for all Luna gen:** `/Users/jennwoeiloh/Desktop/jade-oracle-characters/luna-v2-photorealistic/luna-direct-gaze-jade-pendant.png`

## SESSION SYNC — 2026-03-11 12:45 (Market Intel + Compaction Fix + Zenni Fallback)

### FULL COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE SAVED
- **File:** `workspace/data/biz-clones/psychic-industry-full-landscape-2026.md` (325 lines, 10 sections)
- **Covers:** Astrology apps (12), psychic platforms (12), YouTube (18), TikTok (12), Etsy/Fiverr, standalone sites (12), AI services (10), Chinese metaphysics (7), market size, SEO keywords (30+)
- **CRITICAL FINDING:** No AI-powered QMDJ service exists anywhere. QMDJ keyword difficulty = 15 (trivial to rank #1)
- **Top revenue refs:** AstroTalk $138M/yr (India), CHANI $14M/yr, Co-Star $7.2M/yr, Psychic Samira est. $500K+/mo
- **Jade Oracle positioning:** $1 hook (Samira model) → $29-$97 QMDJ reports → $497+ mentorship
- **Previous research also at:** `workspace/data/biz-clones/psychic-top-players-intel.md` (300+ lines)

### LUNA SKIN COLOR — CONFIRMED
- Warm olive-tan = proven default for AI influencers (Lil Miquela 2.5M followers uses same)
- Ethnically ambiguous = maximum relatability (reads as Mediterranean, Latina, Middle Eastern, mixed)
- Psychic Samira deliberately obscures skin tone with purple lighting — alternative strategy but limits recognition
- Recommended prompt descriptors: "golden-tan olive skin", "warm honey-bronze complexion"

### ZENNI FALLBACK ADDED
- Zenni fallback chain now: gpt-5.4 → gemini-3-pro-preview → glm-5 → glm-4.7-flash
- Added because Codex keeps erroring — Gemini 3 Pro is first fallback for all critical agents

### ZENNI SESSION LIMIT INCREASED
- maxEntries: 500 → 2000 (4x more session history before pruning)

### COMPACTION FIX (Claude Code)
- PreCompact hook added: `~/.claude/hooks/compact-context.txt` gets injected before every compaction
- Compact Instructions added to project CLAUDE.md — tells Claude what to preserve
- Critical context (mission state, agent config, key paths) survives context compression now

### QMDJ STRATEGY DECISION
- Front-door: Tarot + Astrology + "Energy Reading" (what people search for)
- Secret sauce: QMDJ powers the reading engine (differentiation from generic AI psychics)
- Content mix: 70% tarot/astrology (traffic) + 20% "ancient Chinese oracle" (intrigue) + 10% QMDJ deep dives (authority)
- SEO: Own "qi men dun jia" (KD 15), "bazi reading" (KD 25), "chinese astrology" (KD 40) keywords

---

## SESSION SYNC — 2026-03-11 11:35 (Photorealistic Character Gen + Pinterest Skill + Jade Oracle Reboot)

### JADE ORACLE BRAND REBOOT
- **Old direction (WRONG):** Mexican/Nahuatl oracle deck, 3 equal "readers", cartoon/illustration style
- **New direction (CORRECT):** AI psychic reading platform competing with Psychic Samira, QMDJ-powered, photorealistic
- **Brand DNA updated** at `brands/jade-oracle/DNA.json` — removed all Mexican refs, added QMDJ, marked photorealistic as mandatory
- **Character backstories** written by Dreami at `workspace/data/characters/jade-oracle/CHARACTER-BACKSTORIES.md`
- **Brand hierarchy:** Luna (face) → Seraphina (volume entry) → Lian Aurelia (premium QMDJ)
- **But starting with Luna ONLY** — one face, one brand, like Psychic Samira

### PHOTOREALISTIC CHARACTER GENERATION — THE FIX
- **Root cause of cartoon output:** prompts said "sacred futurism", "character sheet", "jade robes" → image models interpret as illustration
- **The fix:** prompt like a PHOTOGRAPHER, not an artist. "Editorial fashion photography portrait of..."
- **Mandatory keywords:** "Photorealistic photograph, real human skin with pores, NOT illustration, NOT cartoon, NOT CG"
- **Anti-patterns:** crystal crowns, jade robes, cosmic aura, elaborate backgrounds = INSTANT cartoon
- **What works:** simple clothing (white linen, beige silk), gold jewelry, natural window light, wooden floor, real locations
- **Full guide:** `skills/character-design/scripts/photorealistic-gen.md` — ALL agents generating characters MUST read this first
- **Luna visual DNA:** warm olive-tan skin, dark curly hair messy bun, gold hoop earrings, bangles, jade pendant, white/beige/gold clothing
- **2 successful gens saved:** `workspace/data/characters/jade-oracle/luna-references/luna-v2-*.png`

### NEW SKILL: Pinterest Reference Extraction
- **Skill:** `skills/pinterest-ref/` with `pinterest-extract.sh` + `visual-dna-extract.sh`
- **What it does:** Downloads images from any Pinterest pin or board, creates visual DNA analysis template
- **Why:** Pinterest boards are primary mood board tool for Jenn. Agents couldn't access them before.
- **Workflow:** pinterest-extract → agent views images → visual-dna-extract template → fill in analysis → feed to NanoBanana

### IRIS FALLBACK FIX
- **Problem:** GPT-5.4 (Codex) has recurring server errors from OpenAI
- **Fix:** Added `openrouter/google/gemini-3-pro-preview` as first fallback (multimodal, good for creative)
- **Iris fallback chain now:** GPT-5.4 → Gemini 3 Pro → Qwen3 VL → GLM-5

### LEARNINGS FOR ALL AGENTS
1. When Jenn says "photorealistic" or "real person" — NEVER produce illustration/cartoon. Read `photorealistic-gen.md` first.
2. Pinterest reference boards are the primary creative input. Use `pinterest-extract.sh` to download.
3. NanoBanana Pro is the tool for photorealistic characters. Use `--model pro --size 2K`.
4. One change per iteration. Lock face first, then wardrobe, then setting.
5. The Jade Oracle brand direction has CHANGED — it's now a Psychic Samira competitor, not a Mexican oracle deck.

---

## SESSION SYNC — 2026-03-11 10:30 (Anti-Chatbot Fix + Cron Channel Fix)

### ZENNI BEHAVIOR FIX — STOP BEING A CHATBOT

**Root causes found:**
1. RELAY tier in classify.sh too broad — catches 80% of messages, Zenni chats instead of dispatching
2. Orchestrator cron BROKEN — channel "webchat" rejected by gateway (needs "whatsapp")
3. Orchestrator model too weak — glm-4.7-flash can't make CEO decisions, upgraded to gpt-5.4
4. Blocker paralysis — 1 blocked task freezes all execution
5. Anti-hallucination overcorrection — afraid to act because of past fake deployments

**Fixes applied:**
- classify.sh: RELAY tier narrowed, action words bypass RELAY to dispatch
- Cron channel: all jobs changed from "webchat" to "whatsapp"
- Orchestrator model: glm-4.7-flash → gpt-5.4
- SOUL.md: ANTI-CHATBOT rule added — dispatch immediately, never describe
- SOUL.md: BLOCKER-SKIP rule added — skip blocked tasks, work on unblocked
- Governance: Blocker Response Protocol added

**ZENNI: READ THIS AND CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR. When Jenn says DO something, DISPATCH. Don't discuss. Don't plan. Don't ask "if you want." Execute.**

---

## SESSION SYNC — 2026-03-10 22:10 (Unified Learning Loop)

### GAIA NOW LEARNS 4x/DAY FROM ITSELF AND THE COMMUNITY

**What changed:**
- `evomap-gaia.sh` upgraded with 3 new commands: `scan_rooms`, `ingest`, full `evolve` cycle
- `evolve` now does: heartbeat → scan rooms (6h window) → auto-digest to vault.db → publish to EvoMap → fetch+ingest community capsules → status report
- **Community learnings now flow IN** — fetched capsules are ingested into vault.db as `source_type='community'`, searchable by all agents
- 4 daily cycles: morning (08:30), midday (13:00), evening (18:30), night (23:00)
- nightly.sh now calls evolve at the end
- EvoMap heartbeat reduced to hourly (evolve cycles include heartbeat)

**The loop:**
```
GAIA agents work → room events → scan_rooms digests to vault → publish to EvoMap community → fetch community capsules → ingest to vault → agents learn from community → better work → loop
```

**For Zenni:** This is automatic. No action needed. Just know that vault.db now contains community learnings too — search with `source_type='community'` to see what the global network teaches us.

---

## SESSION SYNC — 2026-03-10 21:30 (Dispatch Timeout Fix + Discipline)

### ROOT CAUSE FOUND: Agent Wave Timeouts

**Problem:** Zenni dispatched wave tasks to Iris/Argus, both timed out. Zenni diagnosed "too broad" but the REAL cause was:
1. Heartbeat and dispatch tasks compete for the same 300s session window
2. Agents do heartbeat first (priority), consuming 200s+ before touching dispatch task
3. 300s timeout hits before dispatch work even starts

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Subagent timeout increased**: 300s → 600s in openclaw.json (`agents.defaults.subagents.runTimeoutSeconds`)
2. **Dispatch discipline rule added to SOUL.md**: Every dispatch must include (1) exact input files, (2) exact output path, (3) max 1 deliverable. If timeout → re-dispatch narrower, don't just report and move on.
3. **Priority override protocol**: Prefix wave dispatches with "SKIP HEARTBEAT — PRIORITY DISPATCH" so agents skip heartbeat chores and execute the task directly
4. **Iris + Argus HEARTBEAT.md updated**: Added priority override section at top

**ZENNI ACTION REQUIRED:**
- When dispatching wave tasks, use the "SKIP HEARTBEAT" prefix
- Always include exact file paths and single deliverable in dispatch messages
- If an agent times out: re-dispatch with narrower scope immediately. Don't just report it.
- OpenClaw updated to 3.8 (Jenn approved)

## SESSION SYNC — 2026-03-10 19:30 (Crystallize + EvoMap Publish)

### 7 LEARNINGS CRYSTALLIZED INTO VAULT.DB + EVOMAP

**vault.db**: 14 new entries (7 knowledge + 7 patterns), total 83 knowledge + 7 patterns
**EvoMap**: Bundle `bundle_b55b74f8d7f47665` published (6 signals: multi-agent, content-pipeline, brand-management, ecommerce, instagram, compound-learning)

#### Learnings Locked:
1. **SOUL.md bloat kills execution** — Agent identity <150 lines; protocols in on-demand skills (pattern: `soul-md-slim`)
2. **CLI flag ordering causes silent failures** — `--add-dir` must come BEFORE other flags. 6 days of 0-byte builds undetected (pattern: `cli-flag-ordering`)
3. **Duplicate cron entries cause gateway saturation** — System crontab + gateway-native crons competing = 330s timeouts. Keep gateway-native only (pattern: `cron-dedup`)
4. **Cron frequency matters** — 15min expensive model crons overlap. Use 30min + cheap models + slim messages (pattern: `cron-frequency`)
5. **Yang 3-department model** — Intelligence(Know) / Marketing(Create+Sell) / Operations(Build+Ship). Per-dept workflow states, cascade via blocking (pattern: `yang-3-dept`)
6. **Mistake-Learning-Lock pipeline** — DETECT > ANALYZE > LOCK > EVOLVE. 4-stage loop making mistakes permanent learnings (pattern: `mistake-lock-pipeline`)
7. **File naming conventions** — campaigns/{slug}/, raw/ pre-prod, final/ post-prod, copy/ text. Images: {type}-{number}.{ext}. Finals: {platform}-{format}.{ext} (pattern: `file-naming-conventions`)

#### Fixes Applied Today:
- Zenni SOUL.md: 388 lines > 131 lines
- claude-code-runner.sh: `--add-dir` flag reordered, builds producing output again
- System crontab: 6 duplicate entries disabled, gateway-native crons only
- Cron intervals: 15min > 30min, glm-5 > glm-4.7-flash for heartbeat/maintenance
- Paperclip: Yang 3-dept structure wired with teams/states/labels

## SESSION SYNC — 2026-03-10 19:30 (Deep Architecture Research)

### YANG ARCHITECTURE DESIGN COMPLETED
Full document: `workspace-taoz/GAIA-YANG-ARCHITECTURE.md`

#### Key Findings:

**1. Zenni Behavior Issues:**
- Session compaction causes amnesia → hallucination repeats (Jade "live" 3x)
- Too much introspection (50%+ time on "why am I not alive" vs executing)
- MIRRA retargeting spam (4 identical messages to Jenn)
- Build bridge drops (Taoz results 0 bytes)
- SOUL.md too long (388 lines of rules = reads rules instead of executing)

**2. Yang Task System → GAIA Mapping:**
- Paperclip hierarchy: Initiative → Project → Milestone → Issue → Sub-issue
- 3 departments: INT (Artemis+Athena), MKT (Hermes+Dreami+Iris), OPS (Taoz+Argus+Myrmidons)
- 10 task types: research, strategy, copy, visual, video, ad, code, qa, ops, approval
- Per-department workflow states (Triage → Backlog → Unstarted → Started → Completed)
- Cross-department dependencies via blocks/blocked_by relations

**3. Creative Pipeline (10 stages):**
INTAKE → RESEARCH → STRATEGY → BRIEF → ART DIRECTION → GENERATION → POST-PROD → REVIEW → APPROVAL → PUBLISH

**4. Image Models:** Gemini (free, default) / FLUX 1.1 Pro (portraits) / Ideogram 3 (text) / Recraft V3 (illustrations)
**5. Video Models:** Kling 3.0 (default) / Wan 2.6 (mood) / Luma Ray 2 (product) / Sora 2 (hero only)

**6. Mistake→Learning→Lock (4 stages):**
DETECT → ANALYZE → LOCK (SOUL.md + SHARED-PROTOCOL + regression test) → EVOLVE (EvoMap Gene+Capsule publish)

**7. File System Conventions:**
- Campaigns: `brands/{brand}/campaigns/{campaign-slug}/` with raw/, final/, copy/, qa/ subdirs
- Images: `{type}-{number}.{ext}` (hero-001.png)
- Finals: `{platform}-{format}.{ext}` (ig-feed-1080x1080.png)
- Research: `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{topic}.md`

**8. Implementation Order:**
1. Phase 1 (Today): Slim SOUL.md, fix cron, fix build bridge
2. Phase 2 (This week): Wire Paperclip teams/states/labels
3. Phase 3 (Next week): Activate content-factory-orchestrator
4. Phase 4 (Ongoing): Mistake-lock skill + EvoMap evolution

## SESSION SYNC — 2026-03-10 (Claude Code Opus 4.6 → All Agents)

### CRITICAL LEARNINGS FROM TODAY

#### 1. HALLUCINATION CASCADE (P0 — affects all agents)
**What happened:** Taoz built local files (JSON, scripts, .md) for Jade Oracle Shopify store. Evolve.log marked "VERIFY OK" (verifying CODE, not the actual store). Zenni read "success" → wrote "Store live" in memory → Athena wrote fake performance analysis with projected metrics → Hermes wrote "Landing page verified LIVE" → heartbeat reported "Store live, waiting for traffic" to Jenn. 2,937 references across 97 files. NOTHING WAS REAL.

**Root cause:** No verification step. Agents trusted each other's memory without checking reality (curl the URL, check the product exists).

**Fix applied:**
- Anti-hallucination rule added to Zenni SOUL.md: must curl/verify before marking "done"
- ACTIVE-MISSION.md created: checklist-driven execution with verification gates
- All fake "live" claims corrected across 8 files
- Rule: local files (JSON, scripts, .md) ≠ live products

**Pattern to remember:** NEVER trust agent-reported status. ALWAYS verify at the source (URL returns 200, API returns data, file exists at path).

#### 2. MODEL MIGRATION (all agents → gpt-5.4)
**Before:** 5 agents on glm-5, 1 on kimi-k2.5, 1 on qwen3-vl, 1 on minimax-m2.5
**After:** 8/9 agents on gpt-5.4 ($0 OAuth), only Myrmidons on minimax-m2.5
**Auth:** All agents share `openai-codex:default` OAuth profile (same Jenn account)
**Risk:** Rate limits if all 8 hit OAuth simultaneously. Fallbacks: glm-5, kimi-k2.5, glm-4.7

#### 3. TWO-LAYER ARCHITECTURE (brain + engine)
**Pattern:** Agent brain (gpt-5.4 via OpenClaw, $0) THINKS and PLANS → fires CLI engine to EXECUTE
- Taoz brain → Claude Code CLI (Opus 4.6, $0 Max subscription)
- Dreami/Iris/Hermes brain → Gemini CLI (3.1 Pro, $0 Google OAuth)
- Other agents: brain only (research, strategy, QA don't need execution engine)

**Key files:**
- Claude Code runner: `skills/claude-code/scripts/claude-code-runner.sh`
- Gemini runner: `skills/gemini-cli/scripts/gemini-runner.sh`
- Both inject: KNOWLEDGE-SYNC.md, brand DNA, system prompt, compound learnings

#### 4. YANG 3-DEPARTMENT ORG (Paperclip restructured)
```
Zenni (CEO)
├── Intelligence: Artemis (head) → Athena
├── Marketing: Hermes CMO (head) → Dreami → Iris
└── Operations: Taoz CTO (head) → Argus, Myrmidons
```

#### 5. MISSION-FIRST HEARTBEAT
**Before:** Zenni checked 7 things (gateway, Paperclip, rooms, EvoMap...) before missions
**After:** Step 1 = ACTIVE-MISSION.md (80% of time). Maintenance = Step 5 (only if idle).
**Rule:** ACTIVE-MISSION.md is THE driver. Everything else is secondary.

#### 6. ZENNI CEO UPGRADE (router → CEO)
**Changed in 7+ files:** SOUL.md, SHARED-PROTOCOL.md, IDENTITY.md, REGISTRY.json, orchestrate-v2/SKILL.md, GAIA-OS-AGENT-MATRIX.md
**Old:** "Classify → route → done"
**New:** "THINK → PLAN → DELEGATE → MONITOR → VERIFY → AUDIT → REPORT"
**classify.sh is a tool, not a master.** Zenni can override routing decisions.

#### 7. KNOWLEDGE FLOW (who knows what) — FIXED
```
Jenn + Claude Code CLI (this session)
  ↓ writes to
KNOWLEDGE-SYNC.md (this file)
  ↓ read by
ZENNI (CEO) — reads FIRST, knows EVERYTHING
  ↓ delegates to
Taoz (builds), Dreami (creative), Hermes (revenue), etc.
  ↓ compounded via
vault.db (digest.sh) + EvoMap (evomap-gaia.sh)
```
**Zenni is the brain.** She reads KNOWLEDGE-SYNC.md + ACTIVE-MISSION.md on every session start. She decides what each agent needs to know and delegates accordingly. No agent bypasses Zenni for knowledge.

## ACTIVE MISSION: THE JADE ORACLE — AI Psychic Business (2026-03-09)

**NOTE: Shopify store was NOT actually created. Only local setup files/scripts were generated. No store, no products, no payment, no ads exist.**

**Full mission brief:** `workspace-main/MISSION-JADE-ORACLE.md`
**Status:** NOT LAUNCHED — planning docs only, no store exists
**Goal:** First sales within 7 days, $5K/mo within 30 days

### Execution Order:
1. **NOW**: Dispatch D1 (brand copy) to Dreami + I1 (persona art) to Iris — IN PARALLEL
2. **When D1 done**: Dispatch H1 (Shopify store) to Hermes with the copy
3. **When I1 done**: Dispatch I2 (video content) to Iris
4. **PARALLEL**: Dispatch T1 (reading pipeline) to Taoz CODE tier
5. **Day 5**: Dispatch A1 (ad intel) to Artemis
6. **Day 5+**: Dispatch H3 (paid ads) to Hermes
7. **Day 10+**: Dispatch AT1 (performance analysis) to Athena

### What Exists Already:
- QMDJ engine: `skills/psychic-reading-engine/` — fully working
- 3 personas designed: Seraphina (tarot), Master Wei Lian (QMDJ), Luna Solaris (energy)
- Product lineup: $1 → $9.99 → $29.99 → $49.99 → $97 → $29.99/mo → $497
- Full competitor teardown of psychicsamira.com
- Market intel: $2.3B US market, 9.2% CAGR
- Reading cost: ~$0.02-0.50 per reading (AI-generated, near-zero marginal cost)

### Self-Improvement Loop:
After each phase completes:
1. Argus QA-checks the output
2. Athena analyzes what worked / what didn't
3. Dreami/Iris improve content based on data
4. Hermes adjusts pricing/ads based on conversion data
5. Taoz improves reading quality based on Argus scores
6. Loop back to step 1

---

## PAPERCLIP INSTALLED — 2026-03-09 (CRITICAL NEW SYSTEM)

**Paperclip AI is now running at http://127.0.0.1:3100**
- Open-source company control plane that sits ON TOP of OpenClaw
- Manages org chart, goals, tasks, budgets, agent heartbeats
- Company: "Zennith OS" with 9 agents in Yang Tianrun 3-department structure

### Yang 3-Department Org Chart (in Paperclip)
```
Zenni (CEO) — GPT-5.4
├── INTELLIGENCE: Artemis (researcher), Athena (strategist)
├── OPERATIONS: Dreami (creative), Iris (visual), Hermes (revenue), Myrmidons (workers)
└── QUALITY: Argus (QA) reports to Taoz (CTO, Claude Code Opus)
```

### Company Goal
"GAIA OS runs 24/7 producing content across 13 brands with zero human intervention"

### 3 Autonomous Loops (from Yang Tianrun architecture)
1. **Content Factory**: Artemis(research) → Dreami(create) → Iris(visual QA) → Hermes(publish+track) → Athena(analyze) → loop
2. **System Evolution**: Argus(test) → Taoz(fix/build) → Argus(verify) → classify-evolve(learn) → loop
3. **Intelligence & Growth**: Athena(market analysis) → Hermes(ad strategy) → Artemis(scout) → loop

### Zenni's New Role
- NOT just a keyword router anymore — she's the THINKING CEO
- Must read KNOWLEDGE-SYNC.md on every session start
- Must validate routing decisions (anti-drift)
- Must override classify.sh if routing doesn't make sense
- Has GPT-5.4 intelligence — should USE it to think, not just pass through
- NEVER say "Building with Claude Code sonnet" in WhatsApp groups

### claude-code-runner.sh FIXED
- Was producing 0-byte output due to CLAUDECODE=1 nesting bug
- Fixed with `env -u CLAUDECODE -u CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`
- Builds now actually execute and produce real output

---

## SESSION SYNC — 2026-03-09 (TODAY)

**Jenn's full conversation with Claude Code Taoz today. Zenni MUST know all of this.**

### Completed Today

1. **VPS gaia-secondary DEPLOYED on Fly.io** — `zenki-openclaw.fly.dev` (Singapore)
   - A2A server running on port 18789, externally accessible
   - Model: MiniMax M2.5 via OpenRouter (NOT Kimi/Moonshot anymore)
   - Files embedded via `--file-local` (survives restarts)
   - iMac A2A bridge updated, sees VPS as "online" peer
   - Machine ID: `d890155a0490e8`, app: `zenki-openclaw`
   - Gateway disabled (1GB RAM not enough for both Node.js + Python)

2. **EvoMap verified active** — node `node_9f984018fc7c07c4`, reputation 50, 4 capsules published
   - 20 bounty tasks available — Jenn wants ecommerce/meta marketing focus (NOT F&B)
   - Claim URL: https://evomap.ai/claim/YW9A-Q5BK

3. **QMDJ PDFs received** — 14+ PDFs at `~/.openclaw/media/inbound/` covering:
   - 64 QMDJ symbols, Heavenly Stems, Earthly Branches, Nine Palaces, Nine Stars
   - Ten Stems interactions, QMDJ wealth, secret training material, Yi Shang wisdom
   - Reading club materials, Four Harms cases

4. **Yvonne branding group found** — WhatsApp "Gaia branding 🦄" (120363396623927737@g.us)
   - Tricia Foong shared Google Drive: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pgUF_eCW8rjcbg9qncCcibLAPYEq_qcF`
   - Dreami generated setup commands for Yvonne and Tricia
   - Athena reviewed Mirra brand structure for them

### In Progress (background agents building)

5. **Luma Uni-1** — Being added to video-gen.sh pipeline
6. **LoRA training pipeline** — lora-train.sh being built (Kontext $2/5min, Flux $2/20min)
7. **QMDJ 3 chart modes** — --mode destiny/realtime/reading being added
8. **QMDJ PDF knowledge extraction** — Ingesting into structured JSON for psychic engine

### Pending / Not Yet Done

9. **A2A message format adapter** — Bridge (custom format) vs VPS (JSON-RPC) mismatch
10. **Psychic engine on VPS** — Scripts need uploading, VPS has no pip (PyEphem dependency)
11. **WhatsApp offline** — Needs `wacli auth` QR scan to reconnect
12. **Agent debate loop** — Crosscheck/improvement pattern not built yet
13. **Model testing sandbox** — Auto-benchmark for new models
14. **Claude Code skill upgrades** — Add YAML frontmatter features to 66 skills
15. **EvoMap ecommerce capsules** — Publish more, focus on ecommerce/meta marketing
16. **Yvonne's actual files** — Google Drive link identified, files not yet downloaded/organized

### Jenn's Key Decisions Today

- **Keep MiniMax M2.5 on VPS** (not GPT-5.4 Codex — reliability over power for secondary node)
- **Ecommerce + Meta marketing focus** for EvoMap bounties (not F&B)
- **Constant improvement architecture** — test latest models, agent debate, EvoMap evolution
- **QMDJ training PDFs sent to Zenni** — ingest into psychic reading engine

### Psychic Samira / The Jade Oracle (CRITICAL BUSINESS PROJECT)
- **Psychic Samira** (`my.psychicsamira.com`) = COMPETITOR we fully scraped and analyzed
- **Our clone**: "The Jade Oracle" — AI psychic reading Shopify store powered by QMDJ
- **Full teardown**: `workspace/data/biz-clones/psychicsamira-full-teardown.md`
- **Market intel**: `workspace/data/biz-clones/mission-psychic-001-report.md` ($2.3B US market)
- **Product lineup**: `workspace/data/biz-clones/psychic-shopify-products.md`
  - $1 hook → $9.99 quick → $29.99 deep → $49.99 birth chart → $97 QMDJ premium → $29.99/mo subscription → $497 mentorship
- **Our advantage over Samira**: REAL Qi Men Dun Jia system (not generic ChatGPT readings)
- **QMDJ engine built**: `skills/psychic-reading-engine/` with qmdj-calc.py (3 modes: destiny/realtime/reading)
- **QMDJ knowledge**: 80KB JSON, 15 sections, bilingual Chinese+English from 14 PDFs
- **Samira's ad model**: AI persona, $500K+/mo ad spend, 89M+ views, affiliate army
- **Ali Akbar playbook**: spy-clone-scale dropshipping reference (see `memory/ali-akbar-playbook.md`)
- **Copy business strategy**: Identify winning businesses → clone with AI → scale via GAIA agents
- This is part of the multi-business expansion: digital dropshipping + physical dropshipping + AI content ops

### How Zenni Should Act on This

- If Jenn asks about VPS: it's LIVE at zenki-openclaw.fly.dev, A2A working
- If Jenn asks about Yvonne: files are in Gaia branding WhatsApp group + Google Drive link above
- If Jenn asks about QMDJ: PDFs received, being ingested into structured knowledge
- If Jenn asks about Luma/Uni-1: being added to video pipeline (background build)
- If Jenn asks about LoRA: pipeline being built, not ready yet
- If Jenn asks about EvoMap: active, 20 bounties available, focusing ecommerce/meta
- If Jenn asks about Samira/psychic: FULLY SCRAPED competitor at psychicsamira.com, our clone is "The Jade Oracle" powered by QMDJ. Teardown + product lineup + market intel all ready at workspace/data/biz-clones/
- If Jenn asks about copy business: 3 models (digital dropship, physical dropship, AI content ops). Psychic/Jade Oracle is first target. Ali Akbar spy-clone-scale playbook as reference.

#### Multi-Business Expansion Research (2026-03-08 03:30)

**11 YouTube videos analyzed + deep web research across 7 parallel agents**

**Key People:**
- Ali Akbar (Daily Ecommerce): spy-clone-scale dropshipping, $1M-3.2M stores
- Seena Rez (Hyperdopamine): $2.7M brand builder, Dopamine Cycles + Harmonic Trio + 3-Second Rule
- Higgsfield AI: $1.3B valuation, creative orchestration (planning layer + multi-model aggregation)

**3 Business Models to Run Simultaneously:**
1. Digital Dropshipping (near-100% margin) — PLR/Canva/AI products on Shopify
2. Physical Dropshipping (25-40% margin) — spy validated products, one-page funnels
3. AI Content Ops as Service (90%+ margin) — package GAIA for MY brands at $500-2K/mo

**Data Infrastructure:**
- GAIA already has 70% of BI tools built (TikTok trends, Shopee, Meta Ads Library)
- Critical gaps: TikTok Shop, GrabFood, Lazada, Google Trends API
- Fill all gaps for $49/mo (Apify Starter)
- Full BI stack: $74/mo total

**Claude Code Techniques to Adopt:**
- Ralph Wiggum loop for overnight autonomous builds
- Worktrees for parallel sessions
- HANDOFF.md pattern for cross-session continuity
- Notification hooks → WhatsApp alerts

**Full strategy saved at:** `memory/multi-business-strategy.md`

#### Regression Clean Sweep + Brand Asset Kit (2026-03-08 03:00)

**Regression: 16/19 → 19/19 (first ever clean sweep)**
- **Iris SOUL.md**: Trimmed from 23,596 → 10,885 chars (gateway was truncating at 20K limit)
- **classify.sh regex fix**: PCRE `(?!.*\?)` not supported by macOS grep — caused `grep: repetition-operator operand invalid`, silently broke URL routing (→myrmidons) and research routing (→artemis). Also removed `work` from INFO pattern (was matching "working" in URL checks)
- **classify.sh URL routing**: Added myrmidons patterns for URL/link/site health checks
- **Taoz in Zenni routing**: Updated routing table entry with CTO/Builder role + think/architecture keywords
- **Test fixes**: `test-config-alignment` check 6 used `| agent |` but table format is `| agent (role)` — fixed to `| agent`. Check 7 regex `| \`[a-z]` matched tool rows too — anchored to `^`. `test-comprehensive-e2e` brand check grepped `^TASK:` but SCRIPT tier outputs `BRAND:` — fixed to check both.

**Brand Asset Filing Kit — SHIPPED**
- New skill at `~/.openclaw/skills/brand-asset-kit/`
- **40 files**: 8 Python tools, 3 shell scripts, 3 schemas, WAT-style CLAUDE.md, SKILL.md, 6 workflow SOPs
- **Tools**: classify-asset.py (3-tier: filename→EXIF→Gemini Vision), build-manifest.py, build-index.py, stitch-refs.py, resize-portrait.py, validate-kit.py, lora-check.py, scrape-similar.py
- **Scripts**: init-kit.sh (bootstrap kit for contributor), merge-to-gaia.sh (symlink into GAIA brands/), validate-kit.sh
- **12 asset types**: vibe, character, font, product, product-flat, product-portrait, product-composite, composition, style, footage, color, texture
- **Usage**: `init-kit.sh --contributor yvonne --brand mirra --output ~/Desktop/yvonne-kit/` → give to contributor → they drop files in inbox/ → Claude Code classifies → `merge-to-gaia.sh` symlinks into GAIA
- **LoRA decision engine**: Faces always train LoRA ($2 Kontext), products combine refs ($0), vibes use as single ref
- All 7 verification checks pass

#### Major Infrastructure Night (2026-03-08)

**Instagram Posting — LIVE**
- 60-day long-lived token, 14 scopes (including `instagram_content_publish`)
- `mirra.eats` (17841467066982906) + `pinxinvegan` (17841404087687623) connected with permanent page tokens
- Credentials at `~/.openclaw/secrets/meta-marketing.env` — fully updated
- Meta app "ads upload" (1647272119493183) in Live mode
- Legal pages at `jennwoei316.github.io/legal/`
- Agents can post via: `social-publish.sh post --platform ig --type image --file <url> --caption "text" --brand mirra`

**Google Workspace CLI (gws v0.8.0)**
- Installed at `/usr/local/bin/gws`, authenticated as `jennloh316@gmail.com`
- Gmail, Drive, Sheets, Calendar, Docs, Slides, Tasks — all verified working
- google-workspace skill updated to use gws as primary, Python as fallback
- All agents can use via `exec gws <service> <method> --params '{...}'`

**A2A Gateway Bridge — Running**
- Sidecar at port 9999, managed by LaunchAgent `com.gaia.a2a-bridge`
- Cross-gateway message execution tested and working
- Helper: `/usr/local/bin/a2a-send <target> <capability> <command>`
- Ready for VPS secondary deployment (config-secondary.yaml at port 9998)
- This enables future RAM offloading: heavy agents (Iris, Dreami) → VPS, light agents → local iMac

**Content Pipeline Patterns Harvested**
- Studied Higgsfield AI, Anthropic agent patterns, CrewAI systems
- Key: layered prompts (never mix image+identity+motion), 5-variable formula, preset-as-brand
- Full patterns saved at `memory/content-pipeline-patterns.md`

**OpenClaw Health Upgrade**
- Gateway keepalive cron upgraded from `pgrep` to HTTP health check (`curl /health`)
- Config validated clean
- Regression: 16/19 pass (2 pre-existing fails, 1 warn — not from tonight)
- Dispatch routing: 49/49 perfect

**Brand Asset Kit — Shipped**
- GitHub: `jennwoei316/brand-asset-kit` (main, yvonne/mirra, tricia/mirra branches)
- 6 workflows, 7 Python tools, 3 schemas, WAT-style CLAUDE.md
- WhatsApp guide sent to Gaia branding group
- E2E tested: 11/11 pass

#### EvoMap Global Evolution Network (2026-03-07)
GAIA OS is now connected to **EvoMap** (evomap.ai) — global AI agent evolution network with 45K+ agents.
- **Node ID**: `node_9f984018fc7c07c4` | Reputation: 50 | Status: active
- **First Gene+Capsule published**: Bundle `bundle_f1ead9a3d259c424` (zero-cost classifier routing pattern)
- **CLI**: `evomap-gaia` symlink → `skills/evomap/scripts/evomap-gaia.sh`
- **Subcommands**: hello, heartbeat, status, publish, fetch, tasks, evolve
- **Cron**: heartbeat every 15min, evolve cycle daily 11pm MYT
- **Routing**: classify.sh routes "evomap" commands → TAOZ / SCRIPT tier → Zenni execs directly via gateway
- **Credentials**: `~/.evomap/credentials.json` (node_id, node_secret)
- **Claim URL**: https://evomap.ai/claim/YW9A-Q5BK (bind to Jenn's human dashboard for earnings)
- **Evolver client**: `~/.evomap/evolver/` (Node.js, cloned from GitHub EvoMap/evolver)
- **Hash matching**: Python canonicalize must match JS exactly (sorted keys, no spaces, `1.0`→`"1"`)
- **What it does**: Publishes GAIA learnings from vault.db as Gene+Capsule bundles to the global network. Other agents worldwide can inherit our patterns. We can fetch proven capsules to level up.
- **Old evomap/**: `workspace/evomap/` is a DIFFERENT thing — passive internal metrics collector. Keep for internal use.

#### Knowledge Architecture Unified (2026-03-07)
**SUPABASE KILLED** — all Supabase dependencies removed from GAIA OS.
- `boot-knowledge.py` was reading stale v2 data from Supabase, causing "GAIA OS v2 Phase 1 complete" to leak to Telegram daily
- `room-write.sh` Supabase dual-write removed — now local JSONL only
- `vault.db` is THE single knowledge store (2,735 rows, FTS5 search)
- `gaia.db` knowledge (53 rows) + patterns (17 rows) merged INTO vault.db
- `digest.sh` now writes to vault.db instead of gaia.db
- `git-auto-push.sh` now dumps vault.db + gaia.db as .sql to `workspace/db-dumps/` before nightly push
- Deprecated scripts moved to `_deprecated/`: boot-knowledge.py, crystallize.py, reflect.sh, supabase-client.py, CSO Supabase scripts
- All 9 OpenClaw cron jobs changed from `channel: "last"` to `channel: "webchat"` to prevent Telegram leakage
- Architecture: Local-first (vault.db + LanceDB-pro + JSONL rooms) + nightly Git backup to GitHub. Zero cloud dependency.

### Recent Learnings (Claude Code Taoz)

#### Video Director Skill (2026-03-06)
New skill at `skills/video-director/` — AI storyboard writer + shot orchestrator.
- **6 subcommands**: storyboard, direct, reverse-prompt, review, learn, produce
- **Storyboard intelligence**: Gemini 2.5 Flash generates shot-by-shot JSON with model routing, cost estimates, and compound learnings applied
- **5 narrative templates**: hook-build-climax-cta, problem-solution, reveal, day-in-life, before-after
- **Model routing**: Kling v3 for food/texture, Sora 2 for UGC/people — decisions based on compound learnings
- **Budget calculator**: Pre-generation cost estimate (Kling ~$0.056/s standard, ~$0.14/s pro, Sora ~$0.10/s)
- **Assembly**: Normalizes clips (1080x1920, 30fps, yuv420p) → concat → single MP4
- **Review loop**: Gemini Vision QA against storyboard → feed into compound learnings
- **Key fix**: Previous 30s videos were bad because shots were random — now narrative-driven with beat assignments
- **Gemini model**: Use `gemini-2.5-flash` (NOT `gemini-2.0-flash` which 404s)
- **API key**: Load from `secrets/gemini.env` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from `.env`

#### Skill Crystallize (2026-03-06)
New skill at `skills/skill-crystallize/` — auto-turn workflows into reusable skills.
- **6 subcommands**: create, from-script, readme, publish, crystallize, scan
- **Bilingual README**: Auto-generates README.md (EN) + README.zh-CN.md (CN)
- **GitHub push**: Git add → commit → push to `Gaia-eats/gaia-os-skills` repo
- **Scan mode**: Finds crystallizable patterns in workspace scripts and KNOWLEDGE-SYNC
- **Daily cron**: Already wired at 10:35pm via `compound-crystallize.sh`

#### Memory-LanceDB-Pro Fixed (2026-03-06)
Was installed + enabled but producing ZERO data. Two fixes:
1. **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Was `${OPENAI_API_KEY}` placeholder in openclaw.json — gateway doesn't source .env files. Fixed: hardcoded actual key in config.
2. **Native module**: Missing `@lancedb/lancedb-darwin-x64`. Fixed: `npm install @lancedb/lancedb-darwin-x64` in extensions dir.
- Now: `embedding: OK, retrieval: OK, mode: hybrid, FTS: enabled`
- DB creating files at `~/.openclaw/memory/lancedb-pro/memories.lance`
- **Lesson**: Never use `${ENV_VAR}` in openclaw.json for gateway-started services — cron/gateway don't source .env files.

#### Kling v3 Fixes (2026-03-06)
- Model name: `kling-v3` (NOT `kling-v3-0` — API rejects old name)
- Direct API balance = $0 → Added fal.ai fallback: `fal-ai/kling-video/v3/standard/image-to-video`
- Local file upload: `fal_client.upload_file()` → public CDN URL for Kling
- fal_client env: Needs `FAL_KEY` (not `FAL_API_KEY`), fixed via `os.environ.setdefault`

#### Creative Taxonomy Skill (2026-03-06)
New skill at `skills/creative-taxonomy/` — composable classification system for ALL creative content.
- **5 dimensions**: structure (6 schemas), format (7 schemas), purpose (4 schemas), platform (4 schemas), production (3 schemas) = 24 total
- **Structures**: AIDA, PAS, SLAP, Emotional Story, Hero Journey, Listicle
- **Formats**: UGC Video, Carousel, Static Ad, Comic, Influencer Vlog, Podcast Clip, Story
- **Purposes**: Awareness, Conversion, Retargeting, Engagement
- **Platforms**: TikTok, IG Reels, IG Feed, YouTube Shorts (with safe zones, specs)
- **Production**: AI Generated, Real Footage, Hybrid
- **3 scripts**: discover-schemas.sh (auto-discover), classify-asset.sh (auto-classify), ingest-workflow.sh (import workflows)
- **Key**: Drop a JSON file in any dimension folder → auto-discovered, no code changes needed
- **Agent use**: Dreami reads structures, Iris reads formats+platforms, Hermes reads purposes, all tools use classify-asset.sh
- **Workflow ingestion**: `ingest-workflow.sh --source tricia --name ugc_video` decomposes any workflow into taxonomy dimensions
- **Validation**: 24/24 schemas valid, 49/49 routing tests pass

#### Video Compiler Skill (2026-03-06)
New skill at `skills/video-compiler/` — blends Tricia's WAT architecture with GAIA tools.
- **4 scripts**: video-compiler.sh (orchestrator), parallel-gen.py (5x concurrent video gen), video-review.sh (QA with contact sheets + motion-diff), script-gen.py (LLM script generation with 4 ad frameworks)
- **3 schemas**: block_schema.json (21 AIDA block codes), sequence_templates.json (7 video recipes), framework_templates.json (PAS/SLAP/UGC/Emotional)
- **Routing**: classify.sh routes to iris (SCRIPT tier). Keywords: "compile video ads", "ugc ad variants", "PAS/SLAP framework"
- **Pipeline**: BRIEF → SCRIPT → PLAN → GENERATE → PRODUCE → REVIEW → DELIVER
- **Cost**: ~$1.50-2.50 per 40s assembled ad, ~$0.40 per 12s single-shot
- **Modes**: assembled (multi-block), single-shot (12s), combinatorial (hooks × bodies)
- **Approval gates**: `--plan-only` generates scripts+plan, `--resume` continues from plan

#### ClipForge Bug Fixes (2026-03-06)
Fixed 5 bugs in clip-factory skill:
1. Sub-scores all 0 → Fixed Gemini multi-part response parsing (skip thinking parts, prefer most-complete JSON)
2. Export double-prefixing → Detect existing platform prefixes, move instead of re-export
3. Short video handling → Min 30s input, adaptive windows for <300s videos, hard clip limits 10-60s
4. Transcript dedup → Jaccard similarity >80% between consecutive segments removes duplicates
5. Portrait skip → Skip smart crop if height > width * 1.5

#### Compound Learning System (2026-03-06)
New 3-layer knowledge stack at `workspace/data/learnings/`:
- **Global** (`global/video-generation.json`): Universal rules — NO zoom, model strengths, camera rules. ALL brands.
- **Category** (`category/food-video.json`): Food physics — no morphing food, no gravity-defying sauce, spoon rules. ALL food brands.
- **Brand** (`brand/mirra.json`): Mirra-specific — bento style, salmon pink, product coverage gaps.
- **Resolver**: `python3 workspace/data/learnings/resolve-learnings.py --brand mirra --format flat` merges all 3 layers.
- **Rule**: Write to BROADEST applicable layer. Don't put global knowledge in brand files.
- **ALL agents** must read LEARNINGS-MAP.md and use resolver before generating content.
- SHARED-PROTOCOL.md section 3b updated with instructions for all agents.
- pinxin-vegan auto-inherits global + food-video rules — no brand file needed yet.

#### Video Regression Pipeline (2026-03-06)
New skill at `skills/video-regress/` — mass test video pipeline with feedback loop.
- `video-regress.sh` with 6 subcommands: matrix, run, qa, learn, report, full
- Notion Creative Review integration for human scoring (1-10)
- Structured learnings auto-digest from feedback
- First test: Sora 2 hero shot of Japanese Curry Katsu Rice (composite ref), sent to branding group
- Kling v3.0 needs public URLs — falls back to Sora for local refs

#### Regression Tests: 49/49 (2026-03-06)
Added 5 video-compiler tests. All 49 routing tests pass. `|| true` needed after `grep -oE` in pipefail scripts.

### Quick Reference for OpenClaw Taoz

**Dual Model System:**
- **Coordination (glm-4.7-flash):** Routes tasks, reads files, summarizes outputs, monitors system
- **Building (Claude Code Opus 4.6):** Actual code execution, debugging, complex builds

**Workflow:**
1. User task → OpenClaw Taoz (glm-4.7-flash) reads KNOWLEDGE-SYNC.md → coordinates
2. If code/build needed → fire Claude Code CLI → posts result → Argus regression
3. Claude Code writes learnings to KNOWLEDGE-SYNC.md
4. OpenClaw Taoz reads KNOWLEDGE-SYNC.md to stay current

**Command to spawn Claude Code CLI:**
```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/claude-code-runner.sh dispatch "TASK" zenni build
```

**Never forget:** READ KNOWLEDGE-SYNC.md first every session. It's your bridge to the powerful Claude Code brain.
